An attempt to build a language that compiles to wasm in idris2

Right Now:
A very limited calculator that supports
    - addition
    and
    - addition

Wasm codgen TODO ;-)

Goals:
- Compile to wasm
- Fast compilation & Type Checking
- Sum Types
- mutability XOR alias a la rust or some time of afinity in type system
- Minimal allocation boilerplate
- Practical
- Familiar

Why Idris?
I wanted more experience with I wanted more experience with dependent types and effect systems.
